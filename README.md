# Personal Portfolio
Hello! My name is Reagan Pawlyszyn and I am an aspiring game designer and engineer. This is a personal collection of past and present projects that I have been working on throughout the course of IOS Mobile App Development at Eden Prairie Highschool. I found that my skills as a social media manager for the Eden Prairie Drama Department coexisted with the more artistic side of app development, so I spent my time designing icons, creating graphics, and improving user experience.

Whisk-d is a single player ‘whack a mole’ simulator that follows the story of a cat named Whisk. Whisk lives in an abandoned shed and embarks on a grand adventure in order to find its family! Throughout the game, Whisk must find and tap on many mice hidden throughout many levels, but don’t hit the rats, who bite! Each mouse caught produces ‘chz-btx’, which is a form of currency that allows for Whisk to upgrade kitty accessories, unlock feline friends, and progress through the story! While working on this game, I was reminded of Studio Ghibli and their creation of animated animals. This has been a huge project, and I am still working on the basic graphics. When I become more familiar with Swift and the programming languages I need, I hope to get this app up and running!
