# Personal Portfolio
Hello! My name is Reagan Pawlyszyn and I am an aspiring game designer and engineer. This is a personal collection of past and present projects that I have been working on throughout the course of IOS Mobile App Development at Eden Prairie Highschool. I found that my skills as a social media manager for the Eden Prairie Drama Department coexisted with the more artistic side of app development, so I spent my time designing icons, creating graphics, and improving user experience.

Whisk-d is a single player ‘whack a mole’ simulator that follows the story of a cat named Whisk. Whisk lives in an abandoned shed and embarks on a grand adventure in order to find its family! Throughout the game, Whisk must find and tap on many mice hidden throughout many levels, but don’t hit the rats, who bite! Each mouse caught produces ‘chz-btx’, which is a form of currency that allows for Whisk to upgrade kitty accessories, unlock feline friends, and progress through the story! While working on this game, I was reminded of Studio Ghibli and their creation of animated animals. This has been a huge project, and I am still working on the basic graphics. When I become more familiar with Swift and the programming languages I need, I hope to get this app up and running!

Will Peyer and Noah Rubin’s Sky Skirmish is a mobile 2D designed fighter jet game. The game can be described as a ‘bullet-hell’, where the jet’s task is to shoot asteroids, enemy jets, and satellites. Will reached out to me and asked for an app icon for the app store. My creative process was focused on making sure the player would look at the photo and immediately think of a fighter-jet game. I decided on taking the image from an enemy ship’s viewpoint, which allowed for a more realistic setting for the game. Using Canva and sketch, I was able to capture what looks like a deadly blow from one ship to another in a clear sky. I enjoyed the creative freedom Will gave me for this project, and I love the atmosphere it gives off.

# [Turret Shot](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Turret-Shot)

Jacob Swanson’s Turret Shot game was one of the first graphic projects that I made. Jacob requested creating a play button and two sliders to show the player and opposing players’ controls. While designing these, I researched actual tanks and looked at control panels for militant weapons as a basis. I decided on a more simple design in order to keep the attention on the strategizing aspect of the game. Jake wanted a simple icon to fit the overall design of the game, so I tried to emphasize the contrasting elements of the player and opposing player’s tanks. Overall, I really enjoyed how these turned out!

Cole Nelson’s app required multiple spaceships of different colors and sizes, each of which would be unlocked as the player progresses throughout the game. I settled on a more pixelated design for the ships, as I wanted to make each spaceship unique and original! I was inspired by different types of bugs, and I had a really hard time figuring out color pallets for each ship. The trickiest part of this project was working on the details of each ship, especially the highlights. Every ship was a mini success, and I am so happy with how they turned out!
